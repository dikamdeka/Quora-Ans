20 seconds of courage
Well, its a hack you can use when you get paralysis by
analysis.

This line is from one of my favourite movies, We Bought A Zoo.

Here's what Benjamin Mee says to his son Dylan...
" You know, sometimes all you need is 60 seconds of insane 
courage. Just, literally 20 seconds of just embarrassing bravery.
 And I promise you, something great will come of it. "

 
This line has always helped me when I get stuck in to do or 
not to do situations.

You too can use this technique to get past uncomfortable
situations. 

Just for 20 seconds, forget everything and do whatever comes
to your mind. That will really shut off the inner chatter
of your mind which stops us from doing what we want.

All it takes is only 20 seconds.

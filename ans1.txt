Well!No external things matter when it comes to pure happiness and bliss.
You can use mobile all day long and not be happy.


On the other hand there are people 
on this very planet having neither a smartphone nor a television and still happy.
Human connection is very essential for lasting happiness and satisfaction rather 
than gadgets.


Unconditionally loving each and every person as they are and helping them 
grow in their lives can give you happiness and at the same time you will be busy too.


Actually these electronic gadgets,internet and social networking are keeping people
from being really happy.People project their best moments on this social networking sites
which is not their actual reality.Being humans we tend to compare these best moments of someone
to our daily life and feel depressed.

When it comes to keep yourself busy,I think there are a lot of ways to do so.
Learn a new language,read a good book(I can name you some good books,if you don't have an option),exercise(daily),
Listen to music,sing a song aloud(it will improve your mood),smile at strangers and so on.
